= 09. Timing attack on RSA with Montgomery Multiplication

* Download the Mathematica notebook link:files/timing_attack_rsa_montgomery_part1_only_en.nb[] or
 the Jupyter notebook link:files/timing_attack_rsa_montgomery_student.ipynb[]
* Observe how the timing attack works on multiplication
* Finish the second method attacking squaring

*Homework for 3 points until next week* (but it is doable in the class)
